# Wind_Turbine_DataSprint

Overview:
Used SQL, Tablueau, Python (Pandas), and Excel to analyze the global wind energy market. The goal of the 4 day data sprint project was to determine whether or not a fictional Private Equity firm should invest in wind energy. Worked with 3 other team members in an agile sprint using Scrum methodologies – I functioned as the scrum master. We used a Trello board to backlog and track our tasks.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122995201/222990174-3ced751b-98a2-4d78-a097-35503fb84397.png)

Main Goal:
•	Should the PE firm invest in the wind energy market?
•	If so, who should they approach to fund?

Analysis:

We developed a framework comprised of 6 factors to establish who the best possible wind energy developers to approach to fund would be:
•	Net Generation – how much energy is each operator currently producing in total?
•	Capacity – what is their potential to produce energy in the long run?
•	Market Share – how much of the market have they cornered?
•	Turbine Count – how many total turbines do they have in operation?
•	OEM Usage – which manufacturers are they utilizing to build their wind farms?
•	Total Population – what is the total demand for their energy? 

Conclusion:

With all of those factors in mind, these are the top 5 developers we recommend investing in:
•	Avangrid Renewables
•	RWE Renewables
•	EDF Renewable Asset Holdings
•	Invenergy Services LLC
•	Pattern Operators LP
